# LinkLightAdventure
A small game made with the Arduino and the Processing IDE as well as Pure Data.

To make use of this project, you will need an arduino board, Pure Data, and
the Processing IDE. It will be hard to work on your own without knowing the
correct wire setup for your arduino board.

- If anybody is interested in seeing the wire setup you can email me at
  rshoul2@gmail.com and I will send you some pictures and a description of
  the setup. I will put a couple videos in the repository to show its
  functionality.
